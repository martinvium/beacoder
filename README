DESCRIPTION

    A "text adventure" played directly in your IDE, reading the story via method hints and 
    documentation.

    Fill in the blanks in this intriguing story. Each chapter is a test in a TestCase spanning
    the entire act. Act by calling actions on your Player object, passing in Objects of the world
    which then in turn returns new locations and objects, for you to combine and inspect in this
    detailed and mutable world.

REQUIREMENTS
   
    * PHP 5.3+
    * PHPUnit 3.5+

GETTING STARTED

    Open the file "/game/ActOneTest.php" in your IDE.
